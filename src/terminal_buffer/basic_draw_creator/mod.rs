//! Utilities for collecting simple drawable terminal operations and computing their bounding box.
//!
//! `BasicDrawCreator` stores a list of `BasicDraw` operations (single characters at integer points)
//! and provides helpers to push single characters or lines (Bresenham) and to compute the bounding
//! rectangle covering all drawn points.
