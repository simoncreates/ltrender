# ltrender

powerful rendering engine for terminal tools and games.


## TODO:
- make sure engine is easy to use and easy to understand
- documentation
- more examples

## Improve:
- add more testing

## Remember:
- remember to make the renderers interval expansion happen, after the diffing has been done, so intervals, that have not change aren diffed
