# ltrender

powerful rendering engine for terminal tools and games.


## TODO:
- documentation
- more examples
- allow the screen select handler to be passed into renderer

## Improve:
- add more testing

## Remember:
- remember to make the renderers interval expansion happen, after the diffing has been done, so intervals, that have not change aren diffed
