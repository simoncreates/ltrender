# ltrender

powerful rendering engine for terminal tools and games.


## TODO:
- documentation
- more examples
- fix bug in screens demo, where the selected screen text is not shown after the first click
it is related to the screen select handler, which does not detect the first click

## Improve:
- add more testing

## Remember:
- remember to make the renderers interval expansion happen, after the diffing has been done, so intervals, that have not change aren diffed
